# Parking-Tickets-Analysis_Using_Hive

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply the learnings of the module on Hive to a real-life dataset, specifically analyzing parking ticket data from New York City using Hive.

## Problem Statement
New York City faces a significant challenge with parking space scarcity, leading to a high number of parking tickets issued. The NYC Police Department collects data on parking violations, which is available on the NYC Open Data portal. The task is to analyze this data to gain insights into parking violations.

## Analysis Tasks

### Part-I: Examine the data
- Find the total number of tickets issued in 2017.
- Find the total number of states to which the cars with tickets belong.
- Find the number of tickets with missing addresses.

### Part-II: Aggregation tasks
- Analyze parking violation frequencies across different times of the day.
- Find the 3 most common violation codes and their corresponding times of day.
- Determine seasonality by dividing the year into seasons and finding the most common violations for each season.

## Additional Notes
- Use appropriate table formats and optimizations in your queries.
- Reference Apache Hive documentation and tutorials for date-time formatting.
- Dataset mirror links are provided in case the S3 link is down.
